<h2>A word from our sponsor...</h2>
<p>In the Age of Ancients,</p>
<p>The world was unformed, shrouded by fog.</p>
<p>A land of grey crags, Archtrees, and everlasting Dragons.</p>
<p>But then there was <span class="Fire">Fire.</span></p>
<p>And with <span class="Fire">Fire</span> came disparity.</p>
<p id="HC">Heat and Cold,</p>
<p id="LD">Life and Death,</p>
<p id="AndLD">And of course, Light and Dark.</p>
<p>Then from the Dark, they came,</p>
<p>And found the souls of Lords within the flame.</p>
<p>Nito, the first of the dead. &nbsp The Witch of Izalith, and her Daughters of Chaos.</p>
	<img class="LeftPic" src="images/Nito.png" alt="Aw he dead." title="What a Gravelord">
	<img class="RightPic" src="images/WoI.png" alt="Poo." title="Witchin'!">
<p>Gwyn, Lord of Sunlight, and his faithful knights. And the Furtive Pygmy, so easily forgotten.</p>
	<img class="LeftPic" src="images/Gwyn.jpeg" alt="Here today, Gwyn tomorrow." title="Gwyn">
	<img class="RightPic" src="images/Pyg.jpeg" alt="Dead Pyg." title="Squeaky cuddle Pyg.">	
<p>With the strength of Lords, they challenged the Dragons.</p>
<p>Gwyn's mighty bolts peeled apart their stone scales.</p>
<p>The witches weaved great firestorms.</p>
<p>Nito unleashed a miasma of death and disease.</p>
<p>And Seath the Scaleless betrayed his own...and the Dragons were no more.</p>
<p>Thus began the Age of <span class="Fire">Fire.</span></p>
<p>But soon the flames will fade, and only Dark will remain.</p>
<p>Even now, there are only embers,</p>
<p>And man sees not Light, but only endless nights.</p>
<p>And amongst the living are seen, carriers of the accursed Darksign.</p>
<p>Yes, indeed.</p>
<p>The Darksign brands the Undead.</p>
<p>And in this land, the Undead are corralled and led to the north,</p>
<p>Where they are locked away, to await the end of the world.</p>
<p>This is your fate.</p>
